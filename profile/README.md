## 💡 The Mission

Every month, developers pay hundreds of dollars for tools that should be free. **Cursor** charges $20/month. **v0.dev** costs $20/month for 500 generations. **GitHub Copilot** is $10-19/month.

We're changing that.

Aethyrion is building a complete ecosystem of **100% free, open-source alternatives** to expensive paid developer tools. No VC funding. No corporate overlords. Just a developer who believes great tools shouldn't cost $100/month.

## 🏗️ Architecture Philosophy

**Everything is built on UPL** - our Universal Provider Layer that abstracts away AI provider differences. This gives every Aethyrion tool:

- **Provider Choice:** Switch between 228+ models seamlessly
- **Cost Optimization:** Use free providers or optimize paid usage
- **Zero Lock-in:** Never stuck with one vendor
- **Future-Proof:** New models appear automatically

This is what makes Aethyrion different - we're not building tools that depend on one AI provider. We're building an ecosystem with choice at its core.

## 🙏 Credits & Inspiration

**UPL** was inspired by [Moonshot's kosong provider](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kosong). They showed us that multi-provider abstraction was possible. We took it further and built an entire ecosystem on top of that insight.

Open source compounds. They shared their work, we built on it, now we're sharing ours. Maybe you'll build something even better.
